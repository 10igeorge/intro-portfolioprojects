    <h1>Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Really terrible websites I've created!</h3>
      <p>
        During our first week at Epicodus, we've learned some programming basics including:
        <ol>
          <li>Basic inline and block elements</li>
          <li>Setting up and using git</li>
          <li>Media-specific elements</li>
          <li>Bootstrap</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        These are only a few of the many things we have learned. In addition to the basics, we have also built several websites. Let's take it back to the early 2000's...
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="#">Statistics Lecture</a>
          <p>
            Here we were asked to create a lecture page on a subject we find incredibly boring. AKA, statistics! This was the first page I built that actually looked functional... Barely.
          </p>

        <a href="#">Izzy's Cupcakes</a>
          <p>
            This website is for a fictional cupcake shop. This was just after learning about classes and here I added several classes to change multiple styling elements, in thise case that was adding red italics and centering specific paragraphs.
          </p>

        <a href="#">Beach House</a>
          <p>
            This one was created to show our newly discovered skills in creating sidebars and floating images/text. For the header I chose an image over text, added a sidebar for upcoming tour dates, floated a profile image of the band members to the right, and finally, floated a list to the right and an album cover to the left at the bottom of the page.
          </p>

        <a href="#">Visit Iceland</a>
          <p>
            In this project, we were asked to create a website about a place we would like to go on vacation. This is when we learned Bootstrap and implemented several elements, including carousels, containers, jumbotrons, columns, and a navigation bar.
